",Acquired by Mrs. Thomas Jenkins,"Anti-slavery sugar bowls were common Abolitionist messaging tools in the 1800’s. The Committee for the Abolition of Slavery, based in England, adopted English potter and entrepreneur Josiah Wedgwood’s design, which is featured on the body of this bowl. The phrase, “Am I not a man and a brother?”, became a central feature of many Abolitionist objects after its coinage in 1787. This sugar bowl is both a unique and common piece of Abolitionist history that reveals how material and ideological circulation were functioning during the time of its production, 1847. This sugar bowl was sent to a Philadelphia-based Anti-Slavery Fair by Queen Victoria. It was then purchased by a Mrs. Thomas Jenkins. Anti-Slavery Fairs were very common in the United States, being used by Abolitionist communities as a way to disseminate political values and ideals. This bowl reveals how Abolitionist messaging became very entangled in domestic spheres as its purpose was to both hold sugar and signal to visitors in the home the politics of its owners. This form of Abolitionist work was exclusively associated with femininity, as most of the Fairs were organized and put on by women. Looking closely at this sugar bowl, and the history embedded in it, reveals the values of Anti-Slavery work at this time. While there is not much information available about both the actual making of this object and where the money that was raised from its selling went, we can see how material culture can become explicitly infused with symbols and messaging as a way to further political agendas.",Image;StillImage,image/jpg,artifact,artifact_image,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0029_A00184918.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/Previews/SC-FHL-R-0029_A00184918.png,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/Previews/SC-FHL-R-0029_A00184918.png,jpg,SC-FHL-R-0029

",Belonged to the Trimble family.,"In the late eighteenth century, global porcelain products were a staple part of household decor, which were typically Asian produced. After the fall of the Chinese Ming dynasty in 1644, ceramic production fell to other countries, such as the Netherlands, the producer of a popular type of ceramic: delftware. Delftware was known for its white ceramic background and painted cobalt blue details, made to repliate Chinese porcelain.To make this ceramic, clay was imported from Northern Ireland and mixed in large tanks outside of the factory. The clay mixture was then molded and fired, and hand-painted by specialized workers, then glazed with a tin glaze. Due to the similarity in this design from other ceramic wall pockets from English factories, it can be speculated that this object is English. Delftware designs typically depict images of nature, such as flowers, birds, and leaves. When displayed inside the home, delftware could bring the tranquility and beauty of nature indoors.
 When paired with a colorful bouquet of flowers, a beautiful, but simple, a ceramic wall pocket could liven up any room inside of the eightenth-century home. At around the time that this wall pocket was produced, delftware had moved from a high-class commodity to a middle-class symbol, even considered ‘out of fashion’ to affluent individuals. Although one might think the wall pocket is against the typical description of the ‘plain’ Quaker, this object was owned by a Quaker family, the Trimbles. We do not know much about this family at the time that we suspect this object was owned, but this wall pocket still brings us closer to understanding Quaker lives and values. With the addition of this wall pocket and other objects in this collection, we are given a glimpse into Quaker history that is revealed to have been more nuanced than at first glance.

Carol Wien et al. (2002). “The Doll Project: Handmade Dolls as Framework for Emergent Curriculum” 5. Swarthmore College, Friends Historical Library",Made by Louisa Starbuck when she was 9 years old.,"This doll is made out of a corn husk, and was made by Louisa Starbuck in 1883 at nine years old. As these dolls were traditionally made by Native American women and girls, this object is placed as originating in North America. However, it is worth noting that doll making is a global cultural tradition, and this doll could have also taken inspiration from English dolls. As Mac Gregor notes, in historic British tradition, “to provide a home for the [homeless] spirit and cultivate his good will, the last sheaves of the harvested wheat were plaited into a corn dolly in which the spirit could live."" Mac Gregor also notes that the creation of a handmade doll inherently tells the story of its creator and owner. Typically, cornhusk dolls can be decorated and dyed with vegetable or berry juice, or with corn kernels, silk, or wildflowers. This doll is missing any sort of colorful decoration that is typical of a child's toy, which could represent Quaker culture. Eisenbarth’s case study of historical Quaker clothing discusses how Quaker children were expected to adhere to the ‘plain clothing’ culture of adult Quakers. The existence of this object as a doll created by and for a young girl is symbolic as well, as children have a tendency to gravitate toward dolls and other objects that resemble humans, typically idolizing them. This leads to awareness about a child’s own features as well as the features of those around them. It is possible that this object was made by Louisa Starbuck when she was a child as a representation of her heritage culture, an idol to carry around as a reminder of who she is and what values her community stands for.",Image;StillImage,image/jpg,artifact,artifact_image,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0072_A00185011.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0072_A00185011.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0072_A00185011.jpg,jpg,SC-FHL-R-0072

The Discipline of the Yearly Meeting of Friends, Held in Philadelphia (Philadelphia:
Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, 1806) ",Mask depicting Quaker Elias Hicks,"This plaster death mask of Elias Hicks, a highly influential 19th-century Quaker, was created immediately after his death, providing a final impression of his face and preserving part of his body in material form. Death masks were a popular practice during the 1800s to remember someone. This type of object, which was once most likely displayed or cherished in a home, became an artifact observed by many at the Friends Historical Library. The death mask not only tells a story about how they were crafted, but also emphasizes the use of an impression of the body to create a material remembrance.This object challenges typical Quaker material culture. In the 1800s, Quakers generally avoided using material objects like portraits or death masks for remembrance because these practices were seen as luxurious and not aligned with Quaker simplicity. Hicks was also against these ideas, refusing to have his portrait taken throughout his life. Yet his role as a symbolic Hicksite leader prompted followers to seek a physical likeness of his face. The origin of this mask is also controversial, as it was made by an unknown Italian sculptor who secretly molded his bust from Hicks’s body, leaving pieces of plaster attached to Elias Hicks. Due to this initial plaster cast, numerous recreations and portraits were made from his death mask, creating a lasting material remembrance. Not only does this mask serve as a preserved material memory of Elias Hicks, but it also signifies a shift in 19th-century Quaker attitudes toward materiality and the body. Followers of Hicks saw him as the symbol of the Hicksite movement and began to remember him through material forms such as portraits.

",Brought to the collection by the Quaker Fisher-Brinton family.,"This small yerba mate gourd, carved from a hollowed calabash, appears simple at first. Its smooth sides and darkened interior show years of steady use. Once held daily in someone’s hand in Argentina, it still reflects a shared ritual that shaped social life across the region. Mate drinking began with the Indigenous Guarani, who viewed the plant as a gift that brought people together. By the 19th century, it had spread across the River Plate and become part of everyday life. Gauchos, the cowhands of the pampas, drank from vessels like this one while working outdoors. Passing a single gourd around a group showed trust and equality. This gourd was crafted from the dried shell of the Lagenaria siceraria plant. Its wide opening and worn surface suggest repeated filling, pouring, and handling. Unlike ornate versions owned by wealthy families, this is a practical tool meant for daily use. The stains inside are the result of thousands of infusions over time. The Fisher-Brinton family, Quakers who lived in rural Argentina in the early 1870s before settling in Pennsylvania, preserved this gourd among their belongings.

Originally used by apothecaries to measure herbs and payments, this specific scale was made to verify the weight of coins, ensuring they were not counterfeit. There is a conversion chart on the inside of the box lid, for conversions to English, French, and Spanish coins of various types. This scale was used in the eighteenth century, before the economic system of the United States had stabilized. Before the United States dollar became standard, the United States used promissory notes or European currencies, though these fluctuated in value and were subject to counterfeiting. Also in the box is a set of weights usable to verify English coins, which suggest that this scale was often used for that specific purpose. The needle at the center of this scale, which would ordinarily stand vertically when the scale was balanced, is crooked and lists slightly to one side. This imperfection may have been what prompted the scale’s owner to stop using it. In 1870, an international gold standard was established so that the value of currency would remain consistent. This could have cemented the scale’s outdated status and confirmed the decision to stop using it, as international trade stabilized considerably after this point. This scale is representative of a newly-minted international trade network, one that was, at the time of the scale’s use, relatively unreliable and required personal monitoring to maintain.",Image;StillImage,image/jpg,artifact,artifact_image,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0105_A00185075.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/Previews/SC-FHL-R-0105_A00185075.png,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/Previews/SC-FHL-R-0105_A00185075.png,jpg,SC-FHL-R-0105

",depics a quaker woman,"This stamp is from the 20th century, made of wood and metal, and depicts a Quaker woman wearing a bonnet. A silhouette of a Quaker, like this stamp, was used in the elite Philadelphia area to distinguish Quakers from non-Quakers. These silhouettes were popular during the 20th century throughout North and Central America and were created using various methods, such as the scissor method, the pen-knife method, and the brush-washed method. For this specific stamp, the metal was most likely cut to form the silhouette. Silhouettes had many different values and were considered sentimental and decorative. In early 20th-century America, “No old room is quite complete without its silhouette, nor modern room furnished in an old-fashioned manner.” Not only were silhouettes used as markers for distinguishing Quakers vs. Non-Quakers, but also used for sentimental value to remember an individual. The stamp also reflects how Quakers expressed their beliefs and ideas, even though it depicts a woman wearing a bonnet. It is a fairly simple stamp that lacks ornamentation, which aligns with Quaker values. Combining stamping and silhouettes into one object also highlights how Quakers “actually participated in the consumer culture of the major metropolitan areas.” This silhouette, when placed on a stamp, becomes a mass-produced image that emphasizes Quaker's new methods of creating images while maintaining their religious values.

Such a style was frequently used for personal items, such as fans or snuffboxes. Loaned to the FHL by quakeress Ella K. Barnard, who also donated a large number of personal items to the objects collection, the box may have origins in Pennsylvania or North and Central America broadly. 

Despite the Quaker and Pennsylvanian associations of this snuffbox, there's a particularly long and gendered history of snuff and the decorative arts of Asia. Chinoiserie and other East Asian inspired arts, including imitation lacquerware, were largely associated with women, combining elements of the foreign and delicate to color ladies dressing rooms and other women-only spaces (Lasser). Presently, the snuffbox remains ever-glossy, with minimal chipping after a near two centuries, retaining its lustre and colorfulness.

Snuff is the “powdered preparation of tobacco” intended to be inhaled through the nose or “dipped” (rubbed on teeth and gums). Tobacco was often ground, fermented, and perfumed with flora such as rose, lavender, clove, jasmine, etc. Though originating in Central and South America, snuff quickly spread to the European world through trade and colonization. In these early cultures, snuff was and believed to have healing properties, preventing the common cold and other ailments.

In Great Britain, the practice of snuff-taking quickly became gendered in its symbolism. Snuff defined a culture of elegance, as engaging in snuff-taking signaled to other Brits one's values and membership in polite society (Katz). As such, a defined etiquette began to grow around the sharing and consumption of snuff. Through popular media, however, snuff-taking transformed into something symbolic of gender disorder, “emasculating” the men of Britain (Katz) and largely symbolizing “female depravity” in its frenzied consumption. This societal disgrace into politeness was seen as a far cry from the rogueish, masculine ways of a former Britain and altered the pre-colonial reputation of snuff as medicinal.",Image;StillImage,image/jpg,artifact,artifact_image,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0792_A00184202.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0792_A00184202.jpg,https://triarte.brynmawr.edu/Media/images/SC-FHL-R-0792_A00184202.jpg,jpg,SC-FHL-R-0792 
mc017,,Medicine Box,1870,Tin medicine box with several paper sachets of herbal remedies,Hand painted floral motifs,"Rhode Island, United States","Tin, paper, various herbs",Paulina Kenyon Foster,,,Paulina Kenyon Foster,"Paulina Kenyon Foster was a Quaker woman who lived in Rhode Island in the late 19th century. She practiced as a community nurse, though there are no records of her patients or how frequently she worked. She did, however, own several books on herbal remedies and took meticulous notes in the margins. Her enthusiastic compiling of resources through the annotation of her books and her collection of various herbs demonstrates that not only was Paulina passionate about her role as a community nurse, she was likely quite good at what she did. 

Most Quaker medicine boxes from this region and time period were made of wood or paper, and are not as finely decorated as Paulina’s metal box, pointing us towards one of the big mysteries of this object: where did the box come from? We know when she owned it and what she used it for, but there is no record of her actually acquiring the case. The other great mystery of this object is where she sourced her herbs from. She likely kept her own garden, but several of the herbs in this box don’t grow in the Northeastern U.S., so where did she get them? 

Not only is this object fascinating for the broader story it can tell about the intersection of women, medical practices, and herbalism in the 19th century, but also because of its utilitarian practicality, which is balanced with delicately hand-painted floral designs.
