## About the Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Quaker community is typically only associated with the Eastern coast of the United States, they participated in material culture that stretched around the globe. This exhibition represents the nuanced history of Quaker culture through the objects that Quakers consumed: that is, acquired, created, displayed and used in their everyday lives.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The physical exhibition (McCabe Library First Floor, from December 9, 2025 to February 1, 2026), three sections highlight Quaker values and practices represented by the objects: “The Metaphorical and Individual Body,” “Local Community Practices,” and “Global Connectedness." This site is a compilation of research on all of the objects in the exhibition. Together, they reveal the complexity of Quaker identity, shaped through the embodied practices, communal life and global connections of material culture.
